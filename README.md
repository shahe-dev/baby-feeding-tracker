## Key Evidence-Based Principles

### 1. Early Allergen Introduction (Israeli LEAP)
- Introduce peanut, egg, sesame, fish, tree nuts between 4-6 months
- **Sustained exposure required:** 3x weekly minimum
- **81% reduction in peanut allergy** with this approach

### 2. Daily Animal Foods (WHO 2023)
- Meat, fish, or eggs **every day**
- Heme iron from meat: 25% absorption
- Fortified cereals: only 10% absorption
- **2.5x better iron from meat**

### 3. Healthy Fats (All Studies)
- No restriction under age 2
- DHA from fatty fish for brain development
- Olive oil, tahini, avocado, egg yolks
- Brain grows 260% in first 2 years

### 4. Dairy-Free Adaptation
- All meal plans exclude dairy (cow milk protein allergy)
- Calcium from: tahini, leafy greens, sardines with bones
- Healthy fats from: olive oil, avocado, nut butters, fish

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Install
- Must use **Safari** (not Chrome or other browsers)
- iOS must be up-to-date
- Try closing Safari and reopening

### Offline Not Working

- Service worker needs to cache resources first
- After first load, works completely offline

### Data Not Saving
- Check iPhone storage space
- Safari settings: allow local storage
- Clear Safari cache and reload app

### Charts Not Showing
- Add at least 2 data points for trend lines
- Weight and height need multiple measurements
- Allergen chart needs at least one week of feeds
